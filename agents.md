## Use cases
- Elevate your AI agents with the robust Obsidian AutoGen framework: LLM Agent taught to control drones: https://www.goodai.com/llm-agent-taught-to-control-drones/


## Multimodal

- GPT4 vision to guide you through a new task now with vision: https://github.com/AmT42/ScreenGPT-Vision

## Record everything
- captures your current topmost application and the URL/file with timestamps : https://github.com/albertz/timecapture
- Memento is a Python app that records everything you do on your computer and lets you go back in time, search, and chat with a LLM (Large Language Model) to find back information about what you did : https://github.com/apirrone/Memento

## Memory
- Don't Use MemGPT!! This is way better (and easier)! Use Sparse Priming Representations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piRMk2KIx2o


## Clicks
